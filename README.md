# Nuindie-pcb

This is the results of my research to reverse engineer the printed circuit board of the Sigor Nuindie Table lamp.
It was originally created to design a custom PCB to replace or hook into the proprietary one, for the purposes of adding compatability with the Matter framework/CHIP project, so that it may be added to supporting smart home ecosystems.

This repository will be updated as the research is completed.

## Prelude

In the following document, Directions will always refer to the corresponding definition below:
- Composition of the shade: Up is the upwards direction when the lamp is fully assembled.
- Of a component: Up is the upwards direction when the silkscreen marking may be read correctly, i.e some components are "upside down"

## Nuindie composition

The lower structure of the lamp can be deduced quite easily through the [battery replacement tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Anm9yBXpk)
