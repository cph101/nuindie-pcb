# Nuindie-pcb

This is the results of my research to reverse engineer the printed circuit board of the Sigor Nuindie Table lamp.
It was originally created to design a custom PCB to replace or hook into the proprietary one, for the purposes of adding compatability with the Matter framework/CHIP project, so that it may be added to supporting smart home ecosystems.

This repository will be updated as the research is completed.
